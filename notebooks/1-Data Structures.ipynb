    "\n",
    "For simplicity, we start with a generalization. Let's say $f$ is defined as $f(x, y)=x+y$ over integers.\n",
    "Suppose we are given an array of integers $A[0...N-1]$. (Note that we are using zero-based indexing.) A Fenwick tree is just an array, $T[0...N-1]$, where each element is equal to the sum of the elements of $A$ in some range $[g(i), i]$:\n",

    "Here, notice that if we choose $g(x)=x$, as an identity function, then we will get exact same copy of the array $A$. However, we are looking for a more optimized way of doing range queries, for this case, summation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** _The Fenwick tree presented here uses zero-based indexing. Many people use a version of the Fenwick tree that uses one-based indexing. As such, you will also find an alternative implementation which uses one-based indexing in the implementation section. Both versions are equivalent in terms of time and memory complexity; however, for less confusion, I prefer the zero-based indexing approach._\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we can write some pseudo code for two main operations: sum of the elements of $A$ in the range $[0,r]$ and dupdate some element $A_i$:\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The function `sum` works as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First, it adds the sum of the range $[g(r), r]$ (i.e. $T[r]$) to the `result`.\n",
    "2. Then, it jumps to the range $[g(g(r) - 1), g(r) - 1]$ and adds this range's sum to the `result`.\n",
    "3. This continues until it jumps from $[0,g(g(...g(r)-1 ...-1)-1]$ to $[g(-1), -1]$; this is where it stops.\n",

    "The function `update` works with the same analogy, but it \"jumps\" in the direction of increasing indices.\n",
    "\n",
    "The complexity of both `sum` and `update` depends on how we choose the function $g(i)$.  The clever part of the algorithm for Fenwick trees is how it uses a special definition of the function  $g$  which can handle both operations in  $O(\\log N)$  time.\n",

A node's parent in the search tree is either its interrogation or update parent (depending on whether the node is a right or left child, respectively), and the other type of parent may be found by multiple upward steps in the search tree.\n",

Each step, either the current node is a fictitious node (index greater than $n$), or we must decide if the position sought is to the left or right of the end of the current node. If the rank sought is less than the Fenwick array value $F[i]$ for the current node, we must search its left subtree. If it is greater, search its right subtree.
